# Analysis of Electric Current Direction using MMS Data
3 Jupyter Notebooks used to perform my Statistcal Analysis of Electric Current Direction using MMS Observations
* Part 1 (): create a database of quasi-stable IMF events (exports database)
* Part 2 (): use database of events to extract curlB and divB dataproducts from MMS (required it's own notebook as it took 10s of hours to run)
* Part 3 (): use database of events with curlB data to create maps and histograms of electric current direction
