# Creating Database of Quasi-Stable IMF Events
* The "Get That MEC Data" loads and exports the dayside (Sept-May) and nightside (Jun-Aug) MMS satellite ephemeris data which will be used to tag the average positions of MMS in each database event 
* "Stable IMF Event Searching" uses OMNI solar wind parameters to search for quasi-stable 30-minute events for each IMF orientation.
